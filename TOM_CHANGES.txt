CHANGES

In the C++ Multinomial Cobweb file:
    - The visualization now includes category utility and "normalized" category utility
    - There's a new function to compute said normalized category utility (norm_cu)
        - I don't think this one is exposed to the python API
            - is api the right word idk
    - CategorizationFuture has methods to:
        - Get the id of the basic level (get_basic_level)
        - Get the id of the best level (get_best_level(instance))
        - Get the list of ids of the path back to the root (get_ancestry)
        - Get a weighted set of ids of the path back to the root (get_weighted_ancestry)
        - NONE OF THESE ARE THREAD SAFE!!!

New testing code:
    - tests/roc_story_test_cobweb.py
        - Tests cobweb on the roc stories, predicts from leaf, writes evalutation data to a file
    - tests/roc_story_test_cobweb_2.py
        - Same as above, but this one has predictions from 'best' and 'basic' levels as well
    - tests/roc_story_test_word2vec.py
        - Tests word2vec in the same way that the previous two files test cobweb.
    - tests/roc_story_graph.py
        - Graphs the data generated by the previous three files.
    - tests/synonym_homonym/synthetic_data.py
        - Creates sentences using a CFG.
    - tests/synonym_homonym/dataset.py
        - Tests cobweb on the CFG dataset, has functions for making a "synonym dataset"
    - tests/synonym_homonym/roc_test_cobweb_layers.py
        - Has code for testing variations of the "two-layer system".
        - Currently uses the CFG data, but can be easily modified to use roc stories.
        - Visualizes trees after the first training pass, graphs data at the end of training
        - train_path has a noise parameter which now that I think about it should be added to test_path as well... that way you can test the effect of useless data on how good the tree is.

by the way sorry about the inconsistency in format between the different testing and training functions... at some point I think some of my changes got reverted which made things worse than they already were...
